# Reservator: a tool for promoting human-friendly interfaces

_Reservator_ (working name) is a device that automatically books rooms
of a certain room booking system. Its rooms display QR codes on iPads,
which, mind you, are fully capable of implementing _this exact
functionality_. This project protests the surrendering of human-first
interfaces for the misguided goal of simplifying machine-to-machine
communication.
